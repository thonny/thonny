4.0.0b1 (2022-03-21)
====================
New & changed
--------------

Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Upgrade bundled Python to 3.10
* Drop support for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7
* The main Windows bundle is now 64-bit. For fallback publish 32-bit bundle with Python 3.8 for 32-bit Windows 10 and 8.1 and all variants of Windows 7 and 8.
* Mac bundle now comes with the universal2 build of Python
* Stop publishing 32-bit Linux bundles.
* Enhance Linux installer script (the .bash-file) to create a venv and pip-install Thonny if run on a platform for which there is no binary bundle available. This means you can now use Linux installer also on Raspberry Pi, #1736

Code completion and analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add the option for automatically getting completions while typing (Tools => Options => Editor)
* Selecting a completion with Tab now replaces the name suffix right of the cursor, #1998
* Turn off requesting completions with Tab in editors by default, #2069
* Show documentation for the selected completion with another Ctrl-Space or automatically (Tools => Options => Editor)
* Add "call-tips" -- a box describing the formal parameters of current method call. Invoke manually with Ctrl-Shift-Space or automatically after typing open parentheses (Tools => Options => Editor)
* Enhance Go-to-definition (Ctrl-click). The name is now underlined while ctrl-hovering over it.

MicroPython
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Use [pipkin](https://pypi.org/project/pipkin/) for managing packages on MicroPython and CircuitPython devices. This enables proper listing of packages together with version info and proper uninstallation.
* Use `.local_rtc` config parameters instead of (oppositely worded) `.utc_clock` in MicroPython back-ends, 116aecd714d5e94a8ad6e244deac44aece5065eb
* Present MicroPython time options (whether to sync time and whether to use local time) in back-end configuration page, #1638
* Automatically interrupt current process when connecting to bare-metal MicroPython or CircuitPython device. This can be turned off at device's settings page, #2059
* Don't hide the output when Stop/Restarting MicroPython, #1805
* Make internal MicroPython errors less intimidating. In several cases the errors are caused by bugs in MicroPython or USB driver and there is no use of showing the stacktrace. User is now directed to restart the device and stacktrace can be checked from the backend.log, #1799
* Make MicroPython back-end advise Ctrl+C also if only whitespace characters get printed, #1755
* Allow running MicroPython scripts without soft-rebooting first, #1565, #1716
* Add generic "MicroPython (RP2040)" back-end in addition to the more specific "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)", #2151
* Mention the possibility to reconfigure file types when denying opening remote files in a system app, #2148

Various
~~~~~~~
* Add new toolbar button which opens the wiki page describing ways to help Ukraine survive the attack from Russia.
* Allow running content of untitled editors without saving, #778
* Clear Shell before starting new process (Run, Debug, Stop/Restart, ...) by default. Can be turned off in Tools => Options => Shell, #1681
* Make stacktrace links to ``<stdin>`` and ``<input>`` pseudo-files go to the editor containing corresponding source, #778
* Ask confirmation for adding .py extension when the user saves the file without any extension to MicroPython/CircuitPython device, #2077
* Don't add the .py extension when the user saves a local file and selects "All files" filter.
* Add Cut/Copy/Paste to the file browser, #2001 by @kr-g
* Make editor remember current line when reloading external changes, #2001 by @kr-g
* Add "Edit => Go to line..." command (Ctrl-G), #2001 by @kr-g
* Add "Rename" command for the local file browser, #2001 by @kr-g
* Add nicer Stop-button for higher resolutions, #1445 by @speedy-10
* Improve icon scaling -- use larger icons when Treeview row height is larger than ``general.large_icon_rowheight_threshold``
* Use default font in Treeviews (including Files and Variables view). Therefore Treeview's font size is now affected by the scaling factor and is not affected by editor font size.
* Use isolated mode for launching Thonny. This includes hiding user-site packages from Thonny's GUI process (not from user programs). Plug-ins now get installed under Thonny's data folder, #2038, #1651
* Allow installing packages for remote CPython backend, #1319
* Flatten the list of interpreters in the backend-switcher menu (lower-right corner of the main window)
* Removed previously deprecated "A special virtual environment". Use regular virtual environments instead.

3.0.0b1 (2018-08-11)
====================

Note: This version is successor of 2.2.0b4 and 2.1.21. Stable release of 2.2.0 was skipped. 
(Incrementing the major version felt more appropriate considering the amount of new and changed features.)

* NEW: Thonny now has two debug modes: beside original AST based debug mode (the "nicer" one, Ctrl+F5) there is now also line-based mode (the "faster" one, Shift+F5), which is not so intuitive but much more efficient. 
* NEW: Both debug modes now support breakpoints (switch on line numbers and double-click on the margin). Big thanks to Raspberry Pi Foundation for the support! 
* NEW: Alternative presentation for call stack (in single window, just like in most debuggers; see Tools => Options => Debugger) 
* NEW: Clicking on the links in stacktrace now shows the variables of those frames.
* NEW: You can re-run your changed program without closing it first (relevant for graphical programs).   
* NEW: Checking "Run => Dock user windows" makes your Tkinter windows stay on top and appear always on the same location. This allows tweaking your turtle programs while looking at current output.
* NEW: "View => Program arguments" opens a box where you can write the argument string for your program   
* NEW: "Tools => Options => Backend => Custom Python interpreter" now allows creating virtual environments   
* NEW: "Tools => Manage packages" now allows installing new packages with all CPython backends, not only virtual environments. If the backend is not a virtual environment it installs to user site packages (with `pip install --user`)
* NEW: Thonny now includes basic support for MicroPython (former `thonny_microbit` plug-in). See https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny/wiki/MicroPython for more info.
* CHANGED: Upgraded Python to version 3.7.0 in Thonny+Python bundles 
* CHANGED: Dropped support for Python 3.4 (both for front-end and back-end)
* CHANGED: Dropped support for Tk 8.5. All bundles (including Mac's) now come with Tk 8.6.8
* CHANGED: Default back-end is now "Same as front-end" (was "A special virtual environment"). This makes deployment easier in classroom setting and it is simpler scheme in general. "Special virtual environment" backend may be removed in future versions.
* CHANGED: Plug-ins will be now installed to regular user site packages directory (was ~/.thonny/plugins)
* CHANGED: If Thonny (front-end) is run from a virtual environment, user directory (with configuration.ini and logs) will be .thonny under virtual environment's root directory (instead of usual ~/.thonny).  
* ENHANCEMENT: Better Windows installer (run as administrator for all-users install)

* TECHNICAL: Refactored the interface between GUI and backend to allow different backend implementations
* TECHNICAL: Previously, with bundled Python, Thonny was using nasty tricks to force pip install packages install under ~/.thonny. Now it creates a proper virtual environment under ~/.thonny and uses this as the backend by default (instead of using interpreter running the GUI directly).
* TECHNICAL: Automatic tkinter updates on the backend are now less invasive

2.0.7 (2017-01-06)
==================
* FIXED: Making font size too small would crash Thonny.
* FIXED: Another take on configuration file corruption. 
* FIXED: Shift-Tab wasnât working in some cases.
* FIXED #165: "Open system shell" did not add Scripts dir to PATH in Windows. 
* FIXED #183: ``from __future__ import`` crashed the debugger.

==================
* FIXED: a bug in Linux installer (configuration file wasnât created in new installations)

2.0.5 (2016-11-30)
==================
* FIXED: Corrected shift key detection (a82bd4d)

2.0.4 (2016-10-26)
==================
* FIXED: Configuration file was occasionally getting corrupted (for mysterious reasons, maybe a bug in Pythonâs configparser)
* FIXED #104: Negative font size crashed Thonny
* FIXED #143: Linux installer fails if desktop isn't named "Desktop". (Later turned out this wasn't fixed for all cases).
* FIXED #134: "Open system shell" doesn't work in Centos 7 KDE 

2.0.3 (2016-09-30)
==================
* FIXED: Quoting in "Open system shell" in Mac. Again. 

2.0.2 (2016-09-30)
==================
* FIXED: Quoting in "Open system shell" in Mac. 

2.0.1 (2016-09-30)
==================
* FIXED #106: Don't let user logs grow too big

2.0.0 (2016-09-29)
==================
* NEW: Added code completion (powered by Jedi: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)
* NEW: Added new command "Tools => Open system shell" which opens terminal where current Python is in PATH.
* CHANGED: Single instance mode is now optional (Tools => Options => General)
* FIXED: Many bugs

1.2.0b2 (2016-02-10)
====================
* NEW: Thonny now runs in single instance mode. Previously, when you opened a py file with Thonny, a new Thonny instance (window) was created even if an instance existed already. This became nuisance if you opened several files. Now Thonny works as single instance program, meaning only one instance of Thonny runs at the time. When you open another file, it is opened in existing window.
* NEW: Editor enhancements. Added option to show line numbers and right margin in the editor. In order to keep first impression cleaner, they are disabled by default. See Tools => Options => Editor. Don't forget that you don't need line numbers for locating lines mentioned in error messages -- you can click them and Thonny shows you the line.
* FIXED: Some bugs where Thonny couldn't prepare some programs for debugging.
