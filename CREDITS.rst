Thonny is thankful to:

Its home
--------
Thonny grew up in University of Tartu (https://www.ut.ee), Institute of Computer Science (https://www.cs.ut.ee).

Supporters
----------
* Development of several features in Thonny 3.0 was proposed and supported by Raspberry Pi Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org).
* Since September 2018, development of Thonny is partially supported by Cybernetica AS (https://cyber.ee).

Python
------
It's a really nice language for teaching programming. It also has some nice technical properties, that made Thonny's program animation features pleasure to implement.
