Its home
--------
Thonny was born in University of Tartu (https://www.ut.ee), Institute of Computer Science (https://www.cs.ut.ee) and the main development is being done here.

Supporters
----------
Development of several features in Thonny 3.0 was proposed and supported by Raspberry Pi Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org).

Python
------
It's a really nice language for teaching programming. It also has some nice technical properties, that made Thonny's program animation features pleasure to implement.
