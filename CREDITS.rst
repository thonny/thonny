Thonny is thankful to:

Its home
--------
Thonny grew up in University of Tartu (https://www.ut.ee), Institute of Computer Science (https://www.cs.ut.ee).

Supporters
----------
* Development of several features in Thonny 3.0 and 3.3 was proposed and supported by Raspberry Pi Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org).
* Since September 2018, development of Thonny is partially supported by Cybernetica AS (https://cyber.ee).

Several companies and organizations have provided us with free hardware for testing Thonny (and for having fun):

* Phidgets Education (https://www.phidgets.com/education/)
* Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/)
* Raspberry Pi Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org)
* M5Stack (https://m5stack.com/)
* Micro:bit educational foundation (https://microbit.org/)
* Calliope (https://calliope.cc/en)

Python
------
It's a really nice language for teaching programming. It also has some nice technical properties, that made Thonny's program animation features pleasure to implement.
