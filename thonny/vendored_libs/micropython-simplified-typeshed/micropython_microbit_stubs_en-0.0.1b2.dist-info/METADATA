# BBC micro:bit MicroPython typing stubs

This package contains Python stub files for 
[MicroPython for micro:bit V2](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/micropython-microbit-v2).

The docstrings are given in language en.

As the package contains stdlib stubs, the _typeshed path_ of the program analyzer (e.g. MyPy or Pyright) 
needs to be configured accordingly.
