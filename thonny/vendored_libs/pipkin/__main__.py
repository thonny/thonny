steps:
    - infer target if no explicit connection parameters are given
    - connect (MP)
    - determine target location on the device/mount
    - sync RTC (MP, install, uninstall). Not required for CP?
    - ensure temp venv for pip operations
    - fetch METADATA-s and RECORD-s (may be empty in all cases except "show -f") and populate venv
    - record current state
    - invoke pip (translate paths in the output)
    - determine deleted and changed dists and remove these on the target (according to actual RECORD-s)
    - determine new and changed dists and copy these to the target
