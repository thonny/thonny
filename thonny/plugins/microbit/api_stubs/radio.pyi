"""The ``radio`` module allows devices to work together via simple wireless
networks.

The radio module is conceptually very simple:

* Broadcast messages are of a certain configurable length (up to 251 bytes).
* Messages received are read from a queue of configurable size (the larger the queue the more RAM is used). If the queue is full, new messages are ignored. Reading a message removes it from the queue.
* Messages are broadcast and received on a preselected channel (numbered 0-83).
* Broadcasts are at a certain level of power - more power means more range.
* Messages are filtered by address (like a house number) and group (like a named recipient at the specified address).
* The rate of throughput can be one of three pre-determined settings.
* Send and receive bytes to work with arbitrary data.
* Use receive_full to obtain full details about an incoming message: the data, receiving signal strength, and a microsecond timestamp when the message arrived.
* As a convenience for children, itâ€™s easy to send and receive messages as strings.
* The default configuration is both sensible and compatible with other platforms that target the BBC micro:bit.

    """Configures various keyword based settings relating to the radio. The
    available settings and their sensible default values are listed below.

    The ``length`` (default=32) defines the maximum length, in bytes, of a
    message sent via the radio. It can be up to 251 bytes long (254 - 3 bytes
    for S0, LENGTH and S1 preamble).

    The ``queue`` (default=3) specifies the number of messages that can be
    stored on the incoming message queue. If there are no spaces left on the
    queue for incoming messages, then the incoming message is dropped.

    The ``channel`` (default=7) can be an integer value from 0 to 100
    (inclusive) that defines an arbitrary "channel" to which the radio is
    tuned. Messages will be sent via this channel and only messages received
    via this channel will be put onto the incoming message queue. Each step is
    1MHz wide, based at 2400MHz.

    The ``power`` (default=6) is an integer value from 0 to 7 (inclusive) to
    indicate the strength of signal used when broadcasting a message. The
    higher the value the stronger the signal, but the more power is consumed
    by the device. The numbering translates to positions in the following list
    of dBm (decibel milliwatt) values: -30, -20, -16, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4.

    The ``address`` (default=0x75626974) is an arbitrary name, expressed as a
    32-bit address, that's used to filter incoming packets at the hardware
    level, keeping only those that match the address you set. The default used
    by other micro:bit related platforms is the default setting used here.

    The ``group`` (default=0) is an 8-bit value (0-255) used with the
    ``address`` when filtering messages. Conceptually, "address" is like a
    house/office address and "group" is like the person at that address to
    which you want to send your message.

    The ``data_rate`` (default=radio.RATE_1MBIT) indicates the speed at which
    data throughput takes place. Can be one of the following contants defined
    in the ``radio`` module : ``RATE_250KBIT``, ``RATE_1MBIT`` or
    ``RATE_2MBIT``.

    If ``config`` is not called then the defaults described above are assumed.

    the next incoming message on the message queue as bytes.
    the RSSI (signal strength): a value between 0 (strongest) and -255 (weakest) as measured in dBm.
    a microsecond timestamp: the value returned by time.ticks_us() when the message was received.
