"""Support for individual pulse based protocols

The `pulseio` module contains classes to provide access to basic pulse IO.
Individual pulses are commonly used in infrared remotes and in DHT
temperature sensors.

All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
are no longer needed if the program continues after use. To do so, either
call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a context manager. See
:ref:`lifetime-and-contextmanagers` for more info."""
