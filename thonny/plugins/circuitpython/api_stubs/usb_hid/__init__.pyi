    **Boot Devices**

    Boot devices implement a fixed, predefined report descriptor, defined in
    https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hid1_12.pdf, Appendix B. A USB host
    can request to use the boot device if the USB device says it is available.
    Usually only a BIOS or other kind of limited-functionality
    host needs boot keyboard support.

    For example, to make a boot keyboard available, you can use this code::

      usb_hid.enable((Device.KEYBOARD), boot_device=1)  # 1 for a keyboard

    If the host requests the boot keyboard, the report descriptor provided by `Device.KEYBOARD`
    will be ignored, and the predefined report descriptor will be used.
    But if the host does not request the boot keyboard,
    the descriptor provided by `Device.KEYBOARD` will be used.

    The HID boot device must usually be the first or only device presented by CircuitPython.
    The HID device will be USB interface number 0.
    To make sure it is the first device, disable other USB devices, including CDC and MSC (CIRCUITPY).
    If you specify a non-zero ``boot_device``, and it is not the first device, CircuitPython
    will enter safe mode to report this error.

      Returns 0 if the host did not request a boot device, or if `usb_hid.enable()`
      was called with ``boot_device=0``, the default, which disables boot device support.
      If the host did request a boot device,
      returns the value of ``boot_device`` set in `usb_hid.enable()`:
      ``1`` for a boot keyboard, or ``2`` for boot mouse.
      However, the standard devices provided by CircuitPython, `Device.KEYBOARD` and `Device.MOUSE`,
      describe reports that match the boot device reports, so you don't need to check this
