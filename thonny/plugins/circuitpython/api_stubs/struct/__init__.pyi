"""Manipulation of c-style data

This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module,
as described below. For more information, refer to the original CPython
documentation: struct.

Supported size/byte order prefixes: *@*, *<*, *>*, *!*.

Supported format codes: *b*, *B*, *x*, *h*, *H*, *i*, *I*, *l*, *L*, *q*, *Q*,
*s*, *P*, *f*, *d* (the latter 2 depending on the floating-point support)."""
