"""Support for frequency based protocols

.. warning:: This module is not available in SAMD21 builds. See the
  :ref:`module-support-matrix` for more info.

All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
are no longer needed if the program continues after use. To do so, either
call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a context manager. See
:ref:`lifetime-and-contextmanagers` for more info.

For example::

  import time
  import frequencyio
  import board

  frequency = frequencyio.FrequencyIn(board.D11)
  frequency.capture_period = 15
  time.sleep(0.1)

This example will initialize the the device, set
:py:data:`~frequencyio.FrequencyIn.capture_period`, and then sleep 0.1 seconds.
CircuitPython will automatically turn off FrequencyIn capture when it resets all
hardware after program completion. Use ``deinit()`` or a ``with`` statement
to do it yourself."""

    is recommended to utilize an average of multiple samples to smooth out readings.

    Frequencies below 1KHz are not currently detectable.
