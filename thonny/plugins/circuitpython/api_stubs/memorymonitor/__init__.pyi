        reallocated with the larger size.

        The buckets are measured in terms of blocks which is the finest granularity of the heap.
        This means bucket 0 will count all allocations less than or equal to the number of bytes
        per block, typically 16. Bucket 2 will be less than or equal to 4 blocks. See
        `bytes_per_block` to convert blocks to bytes.
