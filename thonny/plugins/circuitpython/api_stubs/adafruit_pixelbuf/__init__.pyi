"""A fast RGB(W) pixel buffer library for like NeoPixel and DotStar

The `adafruit_pixelbuf` module provides the :py:class:`PixelBuf` class to accelerate
RGB(W) strip/matrix manipulation, such as DotStar and Neopixel.

Also available as ``_pixelbuf``. This usage has been deprecated.

Byteorders are configured with strings, such as "RGB" or "RGBD"."""
