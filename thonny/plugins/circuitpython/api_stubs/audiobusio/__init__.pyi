"""Support for audio input and output over digital buses

The `audiobusio` module contains classes to provide access to audio IO
over digital buses. These protocols are used to communicate audio to other
chips in the same circuit. It doesn't include audio interconnect protocols
such as S/PDIF.

All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
are no longer needed. To do so, either call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a
context manager."""
