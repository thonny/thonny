"""Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication

The `_bleio` module provides necessary low-level functionality for communicating
using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The '_' prefix indicates this module is meant
for internal use by libraries but not by the end user. Its API may change incompatibly
between minor versions of CircuitPython.
Please use the
`adafruit_ble <https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/ble/en/latest/>`_
CircuitPython library instead, which builds on `_bleio`, and
provides higher-level convenience functionality, including predefined beacons, clients,
servers."""

    The BLE Adapter object manages the discovery and connection to other nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
    This part of the Bluetooth Low Energy Specification is known as Generic Access Profile (GAP).

    Discovery of other devices happens during a scanning process that listens for small packets of
    information, known as advertisements, that are broadcast unencrypted. The advertising packets
    have two different uses. The first is to broadcast a small piece of data to anyone who cares and
    and nothing more. These are known as beacons. The second class of advertisement is to promote
    additional functionality available after the devices establish a connection. For example, a
    BLE heart rate monitor would advertise that it provides the standard BLE Heart Rate Service.

    The Adapter can do both parts of this process: it can scan for other device
    advertisements and it can advertise its own data. Furthermore, Adapters can accept incoming
    connections and also initiate connections."""
