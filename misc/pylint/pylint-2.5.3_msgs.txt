  Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as
  a function.

  Used when a class method is defined without using the decorator syntax.
:no-staticmethod-decorator (R0203): *Consider using a decorator instead of calling staticmethod*
  Used when a static method is defined without using the decorator syntax.
:useless-object-inheritance (R0205): *Class %r inherits from object, can be safely removed from bases in python3*
  Used when a class inherit from object, which under python3 is implicit, hence
  can be safely removed from bases.
:property-with-parameters (R0206): *Cannot have defined parameters for properties*
  Used when we detect that a property also has parameters, which are useless,
  given that properties cannot be called with additional arguments.
:cyclic-import (R0401): *Cyclic import (%s)*
  Used when a cyclic import between two or more modules is detected.
:duplicate-code (R0801): *Similar lines in %s files*
  Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file.
  This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this
  duplication.
:too-many-ancestors (R0901): *Too many ancestors (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many parent classes, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:too-many-instance-attributes (R0902): *Too many instance attributes (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many instance attributes, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:too-few-public-methods (R0903): *Too few public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.
:too-many-public-methods (R0904): *Too many public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:too-many-return-statements (R0911): *Too many return statements (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many return statement, making it hard
  to follow.
:too-many-branches (R0912): *Too many branches (%s/%s)*

  Used when an if statement contains too many boolean expressions.
:consider-merging-isinstance (R1701): *Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(%s, (%s))*
  Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one.
:too-many-nested-blocks (R1702): *Too many nested blocks (%s/%s)*

  Used when an if statement can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.
:redefined-argument-from-local (R1704): *Redefining argument with the local name %r*
  Used when a local name is redefining an argument, which might suggest a
  potential error. This is taken in account only for a handful of name binding
  operations, such as for iteration, with statement assignment and exception
  handler assignment.
:no-else-return (R1705): *Unnecessary "%s" after "return"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.
:consider-using-ternary (R1706): *Consider using ternary (%s)*
  Used when one of known pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:trailing-comma-tuple (R1707): *Disallow trailing comma tuple*
  In Python, a tuple is actually created by the comma symbol, not by the
  parentheses. Unfortunately, one can actually create a tuple by misplacing a
  trailing comma, which can lead to potential weird bugs in your code. You
  should always use parentheses explicitly for creating a tuple.
:stop-iteration-return (R1708): *Do not raise StopIteration in generator, use return statement instead*
  According to PEP479, the raise of StopIteration to end the loop of a
  generator may lead to hard to find bugs. This PEP specify that raise
  StopIteration has to be replaced by a simple return statement
:simplify-boolean-expression (R1709): *Boolean expression may be simplified to %s*
  Emitted when redundant pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:inconsistent-return-statements (R1710): *Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should.*
  According to PEP8, if any return statement returns an expression, any return
  statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return
  None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the
  function (if reachable)
:useless-return (R1711): *Useless return at end of function or method*
  Emitted when a single "return" or "return None" statement is found at the end
  of function or method definition. This statement can safely be removed
  because Python will implicitly return None
:consider-swap-variables (R1712): *Consider using tuple unpacking for swapping variables*
  You do not have to use a temporary variable in order to swap variables. Using
  "tuple unpacking" to directly swap variables makes the intention more clear.
:consider-using-join (R1713): *Consider using str.join(sequence) for concatenating strings from an iterable*
  Using str.join(sequence) is faster, uses less memory and increases
  readability compared to for-loop iteration.
:consider-using-in (R1714): *Consider merging these comparisons with "in" to %r*
  To check if a variable is equal to one of many values,combine the values into
  a tuple and check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of checking
  for equality against each of the values.This is faster and less verbose.
:consider-using-get (R1715): *Consider using dict.get for getting values from a dict if a key is present or a default if not*
  Using the builtin dict.get for getting a value from a dictionary if a key is
  present or a default if not, is simpler and considered more idiomatic,
  although sometimes a bit slower
:chained-comparison (R1716): *Simplify chained comparison between the operands*
  This message is emitted when pylint encounters boolean operation like"a < b
  and b < c", suggesting instead to refactor it to "a < b < c"
:consider-using-dict-comprehension (R1717): *Consider using a dictionary comprehension*
  Emitted when we detect the creation of a dictionary using the dict() callable
  and a transient list. Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this
  code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension.Also
  it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list
:consider-using-set-comprehension (R1718): *Consider using a set comprehension*
  Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to
  read and can be simplified to a set comprehension.Also it is faster since you
  don't need to create another transient list
:simplifiable-if-expression (R1719): *The if expression can be replaced with %s*
  Used when an if expression can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.
:no-else-raise (R1720): *Unnecessary "%s" after "raise"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a raise statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a raise statement.
:unnecessary-comprehension (R1721): *Unnecessary use of a comprehension*
  Instead of using an identitiy comprehension, consider using the list, dict or
  set constructor. It is faster and simpler.
:consider-using-sys-exit (R1722): *Consider using sys.exit()*
  Instead of using exit() or quit(), consider using the sys.exit().
:no-else-break (R1723): *Unnecessary "%s" after "break"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a break statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a break statement.
:no-else-continue (R1724): *Unnecessary "%s" after "continue"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a continue statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a continue statement.
:unreachable (W0101): *Unreachable code*
  Used when there is some code behind a "return" or "raise" statement, which
  will never be accessed.
:dangerous-default-value (W0102): *Dangerous default value %s as argument*
  Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary is detected in a default
  value for an argument.
:pointless-statement (W0104): *Statement seems to have no effect*
  Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.
:pointless-string-statement (W0105): *String statement has no effect*
  Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).
  This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily
  disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of
  comments.
:expression-not-assigned (W0106): *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing*
  Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.
  Probably something else was intended.
:unnecessary-pass (W0107): *Unnecessary pass statement*
  Used when a "pass" statement that can be avoided is encountered.
:unnecessary-lambda (W0108): *Lambda may not be necessary*
  Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same
  argument list as the lambda itself; such lambda expressions are in all but a
  few cases replaceable with the function being called in the body of the
  lambda.
:duplicate-key (W0109): *Duplicate key %r in dictionary*
  Used when a dictionary expression binds the same key multiple times.
:assign-to-new-keyword (W0111): *Name %s will become a keyword in Python %s*
  Used when assignment will become invalid in future Python release due to
  introducing new keyword.
:useless-else-on-loop (W0120): *Else clause on loop without a break statement*
  Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break
  statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as
  the loop itself.
:exec-used (W0122): *Use of exec*
  Used when you use the "exec" statement (function for Python 3), to discourage
  its usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it !
:eval-used (W0123): *Use of eval*
  Used when you use the "eval" function, to discourage its usage. Consider
  using `ast.literal_eval` for safely evaluating strings containing Python
  expressions from untrusted sources.
:confusing-with-statement (W0124): *Following "as" with another context manager looks like a tuple.*
  Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses
  name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as
  a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager
  returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context
  manager.
:using-constant-test (W0125): *Using a conditional statement with a constant value*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) uses a constant value
  for its test. This might not be what the user intended to do.
:missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test (W0126): *Using a conditional statement with potentially wrong function or method call due to missing parentheses*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) seems to wrongly call
  a function due to missing parentheses

:assert-on-string-literal (W0129): *Assert statement has a string literal as its first argument. The assert will %s fail.*
  Used when an assert statement has a string literal as its first argument,
  which will cause the assert to always pass.
:comparison-with-callable (W0143): *Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis?*
  This message is emitted when pylint detects that a comparison with a callable
  was made, which might suggest that some parenthesis were omitted, resulting
  in potential unwanted behaviour.
:lost-exception (W0150): *%s statement in finally block may swallow exception*
  Used when a break or a return statement is found inside the finally clause of
  a try...finally block: the exceptions raised in the try clause will be
  silently swallowed instead of being re-raised.
:assert-on-tuple (W0199): *Assert called on a 2-item-tuple. Did you mean 'assert x,y'?*
  A call of assert on a tuple will always evaluate to true if the tuple is not
  empty, and will always evaluate to false if it is.
:attribute-defined-outside-init (W0201): *Attribute %r defined outside __init__*
  Used when an instance attribute is defined outside the __init__ method.
:bad-staticmethod-argument (W0211): *Static method with %r as first argument*

  Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an
  underscore) is access outside the class or a descendant of the class where
  it's defined.
:arguments-differ (W0221): *Parameters differ from %s %r method*
  Used when a method has a different number of arguments than in the
  implemented interface or in an overridden method.
:signature-differs (W0222): *Signature differs from %s %r method*

  overridden in concrete class.
:super-init-not-called (W0231): *__init__ method from base class %r is not called*
  Used when an ancestor class method has an __init__ method which is not called
  by a derived class.
:no-init (W0232): *Class has no __init__ method*

:non-parent-init-called (W0233): *__init__ method from a non direct base class %r is called*
  Used when an __init__ method is called on a class which is not in the direct
  ancestors for the analysed class.
:useless-super-delegation (W0235): *Useless super delegation in method %r*
  Used whenever we can detect that an overridden method is useless, relying on
  super() delegation to do the same thing as another method from the MRO.
:invalid-overridden-method (W0236): *Method %r was expected to be %r, found it instead as %r*
  Used when we detect that a method was overridden in a way that does not match
  its base class which could result in potential bugs at runtime.
:unnecessary-semicolon (W0301): *Unnecessary semicolon*

  Used when a variable is defined through the "global" statement but no
  assignment to this variable is done.
:global-statement (W0603): *Using the global statement*
  Used when you use the "global" statement to update a global variable. Pylint
  just try to discourage this usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it !

:unbalanced-tuple-unpacking (W0632): *Possible unbalanced tuple unpacking with sequence%s: left side has %d label(s), right side has %d value(s)*
  Used when there is an unbalanced tuple unpacking in assignment
:cell-var-from-loop (W0640): *Cell variable %s defined in loop*
  A variable used in a closure is defined in a loop. This will result in all
  closures using the same value for the closed-over variable.
:possibly-unused-variable (W0641): *Possibly unused variable %r*
  Used when a variable is defined but might not be used. The possibility comes
  from the fact that locals() might be used, which could consume or not the
  said variable
:self-cls-assignment (W0642): *Invalid assignment to %s in method*
  Invalid assignment to self or cls in instance or class method respectively.
:bare-except (W0702): *No exception type(s) specified*
  Used when an except clause doesn't specify exceptions type to catch.
:broad-except (W0703): *Catching too general exception %s*
  Used when an except catches a too general exception, possibly burying
  unrelated errors.
:duplicate-except (W0705): *Catching previously caught exception type %s*
  Used when an except catches a type that was already caught by a previous
  handler.
:try-except-raise (W0706): *The except handler raises immediately*
  Used when an except handler uses raise as its first or only operator. This is
  useless because it raises back the exception immediately. Remove the raise
  operator or the entire try-except-raise block!
:binary-op-exception (W0711): *Exception to catch is the result of a binary "%s" operation*
  Used when the exception to catch is of the form "except A or B:". If
  intending to catch multiple, rewrite as "except (A, B):"
:raising-format-tuple (W0715): *Exception arguments suggest string formatting might be intended*

  of them a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended
  for formatting
:wrong-exception-operation (W0716): *Invalid exception operation. %s*

  operations between exceptions in except handlers.
:keyword-arg-before-vararg (W1113): *Keyword argument before variable positional arguments list in the definition of %s function*
  When defining a keyword argument before variable positional arguments, one
  can end up in having multiple values passed for the aforementioned parameter
  in case the method is called with keyword arguments.

:logging-not-lazy (W1201): *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string % (format_args...))". Use another type of string
  formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the
  logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-
  interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-
  format-interpolation is disabled then you can use str.format.
:logging-format-interpolation (W1202): *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string.format(format_args...))". Use another type of string
  formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the
  logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-
  interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-
  not-lazy is disabled then you can use % formatting as normal.
:logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203): *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(f"...")".Use another type of string formatting instead. You can use %
  formatting but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the

  can use str.format. If logging-not-lazy is disabled then you can use %
  formatting as normal.

  argument that is not required by the format string.
:format-combined-specification (W1305): *Format string contains both automatic field numbering and manual field specification*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string contains both automatic field numbering
  (e.g. '{}') and manual field specification (e.g. '{0}').
:missing-format-attribute (W1306): *Missing format attribute %r in format specifier %r*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string uses an attribute specifier ({0.length}),
  but the argument passed for formatting doesn't have that attribute.
:invalid-format-index (W1307): *Using invalid lookup key %r in format specifier %r*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string uses a lookup specifier ({a[1]}), but the
  argument passed for formatting doesn't contain or doesn't have that key as an
  attribute.
:duplicate-string-formatting-argument (W1308): *Duplicate string formatting argument %r, consider passing as named argument*
  Used when we detect that a string formatting is repeating an argument instead
  of using named string arguments
:f-string-without-interpolation (W1309): *Using an f-string that does not have any interpolated variables*
  Used when we detect an f-string that does not use any interpolation
  variables, in which case it can be either a normal string or a bug in the
  code.
:anomalous-backslash-in-string (W1401): *Anomalous backslash in string: '%s'. String constant might be missing an r prefix.*
  Used when a backslash is in a literal string but not as an escape.
:anomalous-unicode-escape-in-string (W1402): *Anomalous Unicode escape in byte string: '%s'. String constant might be missing an r or u prefix.*
  Used when an escape like \u is encountered in a byte string where it has no
  effect.
:implicit-str-concat (W1404): *Implicit string concatenation found in %s*
  String literals are implicitly concatenated in a literal iterable definition
  : maybe a comma is missing ?
:inconsistent-quotes (W1405): *Quote delimiter %s is inconsistent with the rest of the file*
  Quote delimiters are not used consistently throughout a module (with
  allowances made for avoiding unnecessary escaping).
:bad-open-mode (W1501): *"%s" is not a valid mode for open.*
  Python supports: r, w, a[, x] modes with b, +, and U (only with r) options.
  See http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open
:redundant-unittest-assert (W1503): *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r*
  The first argument of assertTrue and assertFalse is a condition. If a
  constant is passed as parameter, that condition will be always true. In this
  case a warning should be emitted.
:deprecated-method (W1505): *Using deprecated method %s()*
  The method is marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
  Python. Consider looking for an alternative in the documentation.
:bad-thread-instantiation (W1506): *threading.Thread needs the target function*
  The warning is emitted when a threading.Thread class is instantiated without
  the target function being passed. By default, the first parameter is the
  group param, not the target param.
:shallow-copy-environ (W1507): *Using copy.copy(os.environ). Use os.environ.copy() instead.*
  os.environ is not a dict object but proxy object, so shallow copy has still
  effects on original object. See https://bugs.python.org/issue15373 for
  reference.
:invalid-envvar-default (W1508): *%s default type is %s. Expected str or None.*
  Env manipulation functions return None or str values. Supplying anything

:subprocess-popen-preexec-fn (W1509): *Using preexec_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of threads*
  The preexec_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads in

  you must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number of libraries you call
  into.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor
:subprocess-run-check (W1510): *Using subprocess.run without explicitly set `check` is not recommended.*
  The check parameter should always be used with explicitly set `check` keyword
