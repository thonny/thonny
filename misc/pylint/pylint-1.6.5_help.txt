  Master:
    --rcfile=<file>     Specify a configuration file.
    --init-hook=<code>  Python code to execute, usually for sys.path
                        manipulation such as pygtk.require().
    -E, --errors-only   In error mode, checkers without error messages are
                        disabled and for others, only the ERROR messages are
                        displayed, and no reports are done by default
    --py3k              In Python 3 porting mode, all checkers will be
                        disabled and only messages emitted by the porting
                        checker will be displayed
    --ignore=<file>[,<file>...]
                        Add files or directories to the blacklist. They should
                        be base names, not paths. [current: CVS]
    --ignore-patterns=<pattern>[,<pattern>...]
                        Add files or directories matching the regex patterns
                        to the blacklist. The regex matches against base
                        names, not paths. [current: none]
    --persistent=<y_or_n>
                        Pickle collected data for later comparisons. [current:
                        yes]
    --load-plugins=<modules>
                        List of plugins (as comma separated values of python
                        modules names) to load, usually to register additional
                        checkers. [current: none]
    -j <n-processes>, --jobs=<n-processes>
                        Use multiple processes to speed up Pylint. [current:
                        1]
    --extension-pkg-whitelist=<pkg[,pkg]>
                        A comma-separated list of package or module names from
                        where C extensions may be loaded. Extensions are
                        loading into the active Python interpreter and may run
                        arbitrary code [current: none]
    --optimize-ast=<yn>
                        Allow optimization of some AST trees. This will
                        activate a peephole AST optimizer, which will apply
                        various small optimizations. For instance, it can be
                        used to obtain the result of joining multiple strings
                        with the addition operator. Joining a lot of strings
                        can lead to a maximum recursion error in Pylint and
                        this flag can prevent that. It has one side effect,
                        the resulting AST will be different than the one from
                        reality. This option is deprecated and it will be
                        removed in Pylint 2.0. [current: no]

  Commands:
    --help-msg=<msg-id>
                        Display a help message for the given message id and
                        exit. The value may be a comma separated list of
                        message ids.
    --list-msgs         Generate pylint's messages.
    --list-conf-levels  Generate pylint's messages.
    --full-documentation
                        Generate pylint's full documentation.
    --generate-rcfile   Generate a sample configuration file according to the
                        current configuration. You can put other options
                        before this one to get them in the generated
                        configuration.

  Messages control:
    --confidence=<levels>
                        Only show warnings with the listed confidence levels.
                        Leave empty to show all. Valid levels: HIGH,
                        INFERENCE, INFERENCE_FAILURE, UNDEFINED [current:
                        none]
    -e <msg ids>, --enable=<msg ids>
                        Enable the message, report, category or checker with
                        the given id(s). You can either give multiple
                        identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
                        multiple time (only on the command line, not in the
                        configuration file where it should appear only once).
                        See also the "--disable" option for examples.
    -d <msg ids>, --disable=<msg ids>
                        Disable the message, report, category or checker with
                        the given id(s). You can either give multiple
                        identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this option
                        multiple times (only on the command line, not in the
                        configuration file where it should appear only
                        once).You can also use "--disable=all" to disable
                        everything first and then re-enable specific checks.
                        For example, if you want to run only the similarities
                        checker, you can use "--disable=all
                        --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the
                        classes checker, but have no Warning level messages
                        displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
                        --disable=W"

  Reports:
    -f <format>, --output-format=<format>
                        Set the output format. Available formats are text,
                        parseable, colorized, msvs (visual studio) and html.
                        You can also give a reporter class, eg
                        mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass. [current: text]
    --files-output=<y_or_n>
                        Put messages in a separate file for each module /
                        package specified on the command line instead of
                        printing them on stdout. Reports (if any) will be
                        written in a file name "pylint_global.[txt|html]".
                        This option is deprecated and it will be removed in
                        Pylint 2.0. [current: no]
    -r <y_or_n>, --reports=<y_or_n>
                        Tells whether to display a full report or only the
                        messages [current: yes]
    --evaluation=<python_expression>
                        Python expression which should return a note less than
                        10 (10 is the highest note). You have access to the
                        variables errors warning, statement which respectively
                        contain the number of errors / warnings messages and
                        the total number of statements analyzed. This is used
                        by the global evaluation report (RP0004). [current:
                        10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor +
                        convention) / statement) * 10)]
    --msg-template=<template>
                        Template used to display messages. This is a python
                        new-style format string used to format the message
                        information. See doc for all details
