  method>(format_string % (format_args...))". Such calls should leave string
  interpolation to the logging method itself and be written "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string, format_args...)" so that the program may avoid
  incurring the cost of the interpolation in those cases in which no message
  will be logged. For more, see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0282/.

  argument that is not required by the format string. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python < 2.7.
:format-combined-specification (W1305): *Format string contains both automatic field numbering and manual field specification*
  Usen when a PEP 3101 format string contains both automatic field numbering
  (e.g. '{}') and manual field specification (e.g. '{0}'). This message can't be

:missing-format-attribute (W1306): *Missing format attribute %r in format specifier %r*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string uses an attribute specifier ({0.length}),
  but the argument passed for formatting doesn't have that attribute. This
  message can't be emitted when using Python < 2.7.
:invalid-format-index (W1307): *Using invalid lookup key %r in format specifier %r*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string uses a lookup specifier ({a[1]}), but the

  attribute. This message can't be emitted when using Python < 2.7.

:redundant-unittest-assert (W1503): *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r*

  warning should be emitted.
