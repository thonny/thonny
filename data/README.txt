The json files in this folder are consulted by Thonny online, at GitHub, ie. one doesn't need to
install newer Thonny version to benefit from updates made to these files.

circuitpython-variants-* and micropython-variants-* files are used since Thonny 4.0b4.
Other json files are relevant only for older Thonny versions.

circuitpython-variants-* and micropython-variants-* files are generated by scripts. If you want to
change something in them, create an issue first.
